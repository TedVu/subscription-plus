# Subscription Plus

## What is it ?

Subscription Plus application is a software that helps you address the problem of forgetting to cancel a subscription trial. As there is a lot of free offers from many vendors, we tend to forget to cancel a subscription trial, or the vendors only provide the reminder through email and hence the reminder is pretty much confined by the vendors. This application attempts to break that norm.
